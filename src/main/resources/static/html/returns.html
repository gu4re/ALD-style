          At ALD, we understand that sometimes our customers may need to return
          or exchange their shoesEntity for various reasons. We want to ensure that
          our customers are completely satisfied with their purchases, so we
          have created the following return policy:
        </p>
        <ul class="preturns">
          <li>
            Returns and exchanges are accepted within 30 days of purchase.
          </li>
          <li>
            All returned or exchanged items must be in their original condition
            and unworn, with all original tags and packaging.
          </li>
          <li>
            Customers are responsible for the cost of shipping their returned
            items to our warehouse.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the return or exchange is due to an error on our part, such as
            shipping the wrong item, we will cover the cost of return shipping.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refunds will be issued to the original form of payment within 7-10
            business days of receiving the returned item(s).
          </li>
          <li>
            Exchanges will be processed within 2-3 business days of receiving
            the returned item(s), and customers will be notified via email with
            tracking information for the new item(s).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="preturns">
          Please note that we do not offer returns or exchanges on items that
          have been worn or damaged after purchase, except in the case of a
          manufacturing defect. If you believe your item is defective, please
          contact our customer service team immediately for assistance.
        </p>
