        At ALD Shoes, our goal is to make shoe shopping as easy and convenient
        as possible for our customers. That's why we offer a clear and simple
        shipping policy.
      </p>
      <p class="pship">
        <strong>Delivery times:</strong> We promise to deliver your shoes within
        3 to 7 business days after your order is confirmed. If there is any
        delay in processing your order, we will contact you as soon as possible
        to inform you of any issues and provide a new delivery date.
      </p>
      <p class="pship">
        <strong>Shipping cost:</strong> The shipping cost is calculated based on
        the weight of your order and the shipping address. Shipping cost details
        will be provided to you when you place your order. We offer free
        shipping on orders over $100.
      </p>
      <p class="pship">
        <strong>Packaging:</strong> We make sure that your shoes arrive in
        perfect condition, so we send them in a strong and secure box.
      </p>
      <p class="pship">
        <strong>Shipping tracking:</strong> Once your order has been shipped, we
        will provide you with a tracking number so that you can track your
        package and always know where your order is.
      </p>
      <p class="pship">
        <strong>Returns and Exchanges:</strong> If for any reason you are not
        satisfied with your purchase, we offer a 30-day return and exchange
        policy from the date of delivery. See our return and exchange policy for
        more information.

        In short, at ALD Shoes we strive to provide an exceptional online
        shopping experience, and our commitment to delivering quality shoes and
